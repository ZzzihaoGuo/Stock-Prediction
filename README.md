# Stock Prediction Framework 
I make a stock prediction framework which employs different deep learning methods to predict the rise and fall of stocks.

# Algorithms
There are already four algorithms in this framwork (Vanilla, iTransformer, deeplob, GRUModel), you can use different algorithms in configs/config.py

_Sorry, due to confidentiality constraints, I am unable to provide the most efficacious algorithm._
## Vanilla
traditional transformer structure

## GRU
GRU framework model

# Data
_Sorry we cannot provide any data, because the data we use have private factors_

# Training Framework
Leveraging Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) Architecture for Model Training
